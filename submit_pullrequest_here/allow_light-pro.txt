# Possible fix for the data octopus Tiktok: 
#  - You can't follow anyone
#  - Random content doesn't load
#  - Profiles remains empty
#  - The app shows a network error
#  - The same videos are often suggested
# These errors are not reproducible and occur very rarely.
# This Tiktoktupus app is the absolute privacy plague!
# The domains will remain blocked in the native and aggressive lists for the time being.

# Breaks on-demand videos of Mediaset programs from smart TVs
# Because it is a disguised, popular CNAME tracker, it is not unblocked in the aggressive lists.
